wish =

that genTempDir persisted the temp dir in /tmp/test-fns/$repo-dirname/.temp/ instead of in @gitroot/.temp

so that we can eliminate the risk that .temp repos imports will search-upward and find the node_modules or package_json of the @gitroot

so that the temp dir fixtures can safely and portably be totally isolated

and operate exactly the same way on ci and on local, where the gitroot may have had or may not have had build and install steps run

we can guarantee that if its in /tmp/ there wont be any node_modules or package.jsons to find via upward search


---


still, we should _symlink_ at the current location of each temp dir TO the /tmp/ location, so that users can easily discover and observe whats going on in their tmp dirs


---

and still retain the deletion mechanisms to prune old files.
