wish =

wish this package exported some default plugins or extensions or whatever

that we could use to upgrade both jest and vitest user test suites

to report which tests are slow

ideally,
- include both the describe blocks (given,when) as well as the tests themselves
- atleast though, per file, how long it takes each file to run

if there's no clear way to do it per `when` block, then per file is good enough - since the per file is what enables us to shard anyway
