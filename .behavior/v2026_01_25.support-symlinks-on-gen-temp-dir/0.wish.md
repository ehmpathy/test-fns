genTempDir add support for symlinks on boot

e.g.,

in addition to the current ability to clone a fixture into the temp dir

i'd like to have the ability to add some symlinks, at the temp dir, which point to files in the repo root

e.g.,

genTempDir({ ..., symlink: [{ at: `relative/path/in/temp/dir/cwd`, to: `relative/path/in/reporoot/dir/cwd` }] })

that way, we can portably create symlinks to artifacts from the reporoot which can be accessed at expected locations within the test temp dir

specifically

- at = relative path within the temp-dir's cwd
- to = relative path within the repo-root's cwd
