wish it was safe and easy and portable to genTempDir on any os

specifically, we want to ensure that we target a temp repo target that DOES get pruned atlesat on boot if not more often on that machine

for example, on linux, not all distros have a /tmp dir that is auto truncated

some, like ubuntu, instead only have $XDG_RUNTIME_DIR that is actually intended for ephemeral storage

we really only need to support ubuntu and mac

and we want it to be an isomorphic interface, `genTempDir`

ideally, it would also make it easy to generate that test dir with an input fixture to clone

e.g.,

genTestFixture({ clone: 'path/to/fixture/to/clone' })

it can be async or sync. doesn't matter. ideally sync though


---

so,

1. find where exactly to target creation of those fixtures on each machine

and honestly, maybe we should just target @gitroot/.tmp of cwd

and drop a readme in there that says these files should be ttl'd

and maybe have genTempDir actually go ahead and proactively kickoff a prune (within a global bottleneck) of any dirs that were in there over 1hr

and it should ensure that all dirs in there are prefixed with the timestamp that they were created to make it easy to do so

this would be ideal, because it would maximize portability without any os dependencies, all in repo


---

and we also want to ensure that we have comprehensive documentation of this utility on the readme and via jsdoc comments
