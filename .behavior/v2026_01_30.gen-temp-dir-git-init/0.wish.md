genTempDir should support the ability to initialize a git repo within the temp dir

e.g., before clones and symlinks run, we should make it easy to genTempDir({ git: true | { commits: { init: boolean, fixture: boolean } })

which would by default

- initilaize a new git repo
- configure the default user within that repo only 
- commit a no content initial commit with 'began' IF git: { commits: { init: true } }

then 
- after repo and symlinks, commit another with 'cloned' IF git: { commits: { init: true, fixture: true } }

and by default, init: true, fixture: true 

and ensure its clearly documented that we do this on the jsdoc and root readme
