wish =

had a `useThen` export (and a similar useWhen) export

which we could use to simplify the common pattern of


```ts
let response;
then('it succeeds', () => {
  response = await doOperation();
})
then('it did x', () => [
  expect(response....)
])
```


also, update the readme to demonstrate this best practice

e.g.,

```ts
describe('doOperation', () => {
  given('some scene', () => {
    when('[t0] no changes yet', () => {
      then('confirm initial condition x', () => {...})
      then('confirm initial condition y', () => {...})
      then('confirm initial condition z', () => {...})
    })
    const responseFirst = useWhen('[t1] operation is called', () => {
      const response = useThen('operation succeeds', () => {
        return await doOperation(...)
      })
      then('operation responded with x', () => {
        expect(response...)
      })
      then('operation produced effect y', () => {
        const found = await getResource({ by: { uuid: response.affectedResourceUuid }})
        expect(found...)
      })
      then('...')
      return response;
    })
    when('[t2] operation is repeated', () => {
      const response = useThen('operation still succeeds', () => {
        return await doOperation(...)
      })
      then('response was idempotent', () => {
        expect(response).toEqual(responseFirst)
      })
      then('operation effect was idempotent', () => {
        // ...
      })
      then('...')
    })
  })
})

```

we should be able to follow the pattern established by `useBeforeAll` and `useBeforeEach`
